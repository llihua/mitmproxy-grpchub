# mitmproxy-grpchub
This mitmproxy Python plugin passes flow to Java callback function via gRPC.
You should write your own Java client gRPC Server to communicate with this Python gRPC hub plugin.

This is a fork of mitmproxy-hub (https://github.com/CreditTone/mitmproxy-hub) at first, by rewriting with gRPC asyncio.

...incomplete work, I'm working on it...
